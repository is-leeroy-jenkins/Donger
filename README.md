Donger is an AI tool designed to support federal budget/financial analysts, managers, and policy professionals. It integrates large language model based xAI's Grok 3/4
for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), semantic searching, and structured prompt engineering to assist with interpretation of financial
guidance, budget execution data  and a vectorized data set of financial policy documents. Donger is integrated
with  **Grok**  and has been **fine-tuned** on vectorized datasets of inancial management and policy datasets hosted on Huggingface:

## Model Integration

### Grok 3/4 (Primary Inference Engine)

Donger uses **Grok 3** via the Responses API as its primary inference engine. The
application is structured to support:

* Structured response outputs (text, sources, analytical artifacts)
* Tool-generated analysis (tables, derived files)

### Fine-Tuned Models on Hugging Face

[![HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/resolve/main/model-on-hf-sm.svg)](https://huggingface.co/leeroy-jankins/models)

In addition to base Grok capabilities, Donger is designed to leverage **fine-tuned large
language models hosted on Hugging Face**, trained on:

* Federal budget execution data
* Appropriations and fiscal law guidance
* DoD-specific and government-wide policy documentation
* Structured tabular datasets used in budget reporting and analysis

These fine-tuned models improve:

* Domain-specific accuracy
* Terminology alignment (OMB, DoD, Treasury, GAO)
* Consistency when answering budget and execution questions

## 🔑 Required API Keys

- Donger’s capabilities are provided with system instructions for each below.
- Each provider provides language models, embedding models, image generators, or audio systems
- Donger gives users flexibility the ability to improve accuracy by comparing output across model
  ecosystems.

## File A (Account Balances)

- [File A](https://www.usaspending.gov/download_center/custom_account_data) is part of the package
  of data submitted
  to [USAspending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/download_center/custom_account_data) every month
  by federal agencies, as required by the DATA Act. As part of the monthly submission process,
  agencies
  generate File A automatically from data in the [Governmentwide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted
  Trial Balance System (GTAS)](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/gtas/), or choose to upload their own
  custom File A data.

- File A contains budgetary resources, obligation, and outlay data for all the relevant Treasury
  Account Symbols (TAS) in a reporting agency, with additional breakdown by Budget Function. It
  includes both award and
  non-award spending (grouped together), and crosswalks with the SF 133 report.

## SF 133

- The [SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources](https://portal.max.gov/portal/document/SF133/Budget/FACTS%20II%20-%20SF%20133%20Report%20on%20Budget%20Execution%20and%20Budgetary%20Resources.html)
fulfills the requirement in 31
U.S.C. 1511 - 1514 that the President review Federal expenditures at least four times a year.

- SF 133s provide historical reference that can be used to help prepare the President's Budget,
  program operating plans, and spend-out rate estimates.

- Agencies submit the data that appear on these reports to the Department of the Treasury Bureau of
  Fiscal Service. While OMB publishes these reports as a service to agency budget and finance
  offices
  and other interested parties, the underlying data is submitted by the agencies.
